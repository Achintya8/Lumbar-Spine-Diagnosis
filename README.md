## The aim of this project is to automatically diagnose disc herniation,disc bulde in lumbar spine.

## I have used roboflow to label the images with three classes Herniation,Buldging and Nomal.

## The model used is yoloV8m and it was trained for 100 epochs.

## Below is the image with detected classes by the model.
